# MovieDatabaseProjects
Multiple movie database projects built using Java backends and HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap front-ends, demonstrating the different architectures of Java backends. The different backend architectures demonstrated are:
* Model-View-Controller (MVC)
* RESTful Web Service
* Cloud-Based RESTful Web Service
  * Database stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  * Application deployed using Google Cloud App Engine
* WSDL / SOAP Service and Client

**Note: Database connection usernames, passwords, and addresses have been changed from the original.**

All projects, excluding the WSDL/SOAP Service, share a very similar user interface design to better highlight the architectural designs for each project, and to showcase how the various processes can be utilised to create the same design. See below:
